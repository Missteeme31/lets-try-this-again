   <p>Hi! My name is Miriam and I'm learning how to code. &#128563 It's been a bit challenging but incredibly satisfying. There's nothing like the feeling of finally getting 
    a code to work after running it 15 times only to realize you're missing something small like a semi colon or quotation marks. Hell, it literally took me an hour to figure 
    out how to get my GitHub up and running. <b>FUN TIMES!!</b> I know it soinds like I'm being a sarcastic ass, but I am really enjoying this journey. It'll be one of the 
    hardest things I will ever do, but I'm ready for this ride. &#128540</p><br>
